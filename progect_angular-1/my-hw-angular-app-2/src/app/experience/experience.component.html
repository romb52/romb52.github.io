<h3>I am Roman Chertilin.</h3>
<p>
    By profession I am a mechanical engineer of port mechanization. After graduating from the Institute of Marine
    Engineers, I work as a shift foreman in the Department of the Power Engineer in the port of Yuzhny. I have always
    liked math and programming. So now it's more like a hobby, but maybe it will become my new profession. Anyway, it's
    always great to learn something new.
